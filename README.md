# Factions
You are a spymaster coordinating your agents in a cutthroat city where only the bold and the ruthless survive.

This was a learning project to improve my skills with Unity3D and to prototype a game idea.

## How to Play
Investigate areas to acquire missions.
Evaluate the requirements of the mission and send agents whose capabilities fulfill those requirements.
When the missions are complete, reap the rewards.
Equip your agents with items to improve their skills.
